## Pre-Protocol Assignment: Data Pitch

This assignment is more valuable and enjoyable if you work in a group. This is not a requirement, but I highly encourage it. To form groups we will 'pitch' ideas about what kind of data and what kind of audience you would like to create a protocol for... Even if you do not plan to join a group please post your idea (directions below).  

Here are the requirements:

- In 2-3 sentences explain what your topic is and why you think it is important.
- In 1-2 sentences describe a potential audience for this protocol.
- Provide a link(s) and a short description (1-2 sentences) of relevant open data that you could curate for the project. The data must be publicly accessible such that anyone can, with minimal effort, access it.

On Canvas I have created a [forum where you can post your data pitch](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1375713/discussion_topics/5337221). Please post these by the end of Week 2 (April ).
