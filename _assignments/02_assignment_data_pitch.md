## Pre-Protocol Assignment: Data Pitch

The protocol assignment which you will be adding to and refining throughout the ten-week quarter can be more valuable and enjoyable if you work in a group. This is not a requirement, but I highly encourage it. To form groups we will ‘pitch’ ideas about what kind of data and what kind of audience you would like to create a protocol for. No matter whether you intend to join a group or work independently, please post your idea here (directions below).

Here are the requirements:
- In 2-3 sentences explain what your topic is and why you think it is relevant to this course.
- In 1-2 sentences describe a potential audience for this protocol (in business speak: who are your stakeholders?).
- Provide a link(s) and a short description (1-2 sentences) of relevant open data that you could curate for the project. The data must be publicly accessible such that anyone can, with minimal effort, access it.

On Canvas I have created a [forum where you can post your data pitch](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1465297/discussion_topics/6135517). Please post these by the end of Week 2 (April 11th, 2021).
