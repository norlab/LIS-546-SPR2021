## Assignment: User Stories + Use Cases
Throughout class we will read examples data curation work that are "user centered." Two broad techniques for developing requirements of systems that are "human centered" are through use cases, and user stories. The following exercises may be helpful in the work you plan to do this quarter in building a protocol to satisfy a community of data users.

### User Stories
User stories are a simple, but powerful way to capture requirements when doing systems analysis and development.

The level of detail, and the specific narrative style will vary greatly on the intended audience. For example, if we want to create a user story for accessing data stored in our repository we will need to think closely about different types of users, their skills, the ways they could access data, the different data they may want, etc.

This could become a very complicated user story that could be overwhelming to translate into actionable policy or features of our data repository.

Instead of trying to think through each complicated aspect of a user's need we can try to atomize a user experience. In doing so we come up with simple story about the user that tells us the "who what and why" - so that we can figure out "how" ...

*Elements*

The three most basic elements of a user story are:
- Stakeholder - the type of stakeholder might be a user, curators, administrator, etc.
- Feature - this could be a feature of a dataset, a system, or service
- Goal - what is the stakeholder trying to achieve with the feature?

*Templates*
A template for a user story goes something like this:

As a `user` I want `some feature` so that I can achieve some `goal`.

As a `data user of the QDR` I want to `find all datasets about recycling for cities in Pacific Northwest` So that I can reliably `compare recycling program policies and outcomes` for this region.

Some variations on this theme: More recent work in human centered design places the goals first - that is, it attempts to say what is trying to be done, before even saying who is trying to do it...

This is helpful for thinking about goals that may be shared across different user or stakeholder types.

This variation of a user story goes something like:

In order to achieve some business value
As a stakeholder type
I want some new system feature

*Here is your task*

Create user stories that help you understand the potential wants, needs, and desires of your designated community of users. For this first attempt - focus on user stories around data sharing.  How might you satisfy these user stories? What choices do these stories help clarify or obscure about your protocol, and your designated community?

Here is an example that can help clarify the way that user stories are assembled for the protocol: https://rochellelundy.gitbooks.io/r3-recycling-repository/content/r3Recycling/protocolReport/userCommunity.html


### Use Cases (Best Practices)
Another way to begin gathering information about users and their expectations for data are through use cases. As you read in week 5 for class the W3C has developed a template for conducting use cases for data on the web best practices. This exercise asks you to use that template to investigate best practices for data and repositories that are relevant to your quarter protocols.

The simple steps to follow:
- Read the Data on the Web Use Cases & Requirements (as part of your weekly reading) https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr
- Identify a data collection published on the web that is relevant to your protocol.
- Develop a Use Case following the DWBP outline.

**Protocol Deliverable**
Your should begin with a brief 3-5 sentence overview of the data, publisher, and the relevance to your quarter project. Additionally, your report might include the following:

- Elements that characterize the data available (or at least published in summary form) on the web: Domains served by the data; Obligation / Motivation for publishing the data; Potential ways that the domains will use the data; Quality (this will vary – we’ll discuss in class); Lineage (provenance); Size; Type / Format; Rate of Change; Lifespan; Potential audiences.
- Positive aspects of the published data.
- Negative aspects of the published data.
- Challenges that will face data publishers, users, or meeting best practices over time. See: https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/#general-challenges
- Requirements for DWBP: Select two requirements for your data source, and justify why this is a requirement (~3 sentences) (See: https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/#requirements-1
