# Course Overview
Data Curation II examines a broad range of practical and conceptual issues in the field of data curation. As the second in a sequence of courses offered at the UW iSchool, Data Curation II offers an in-depth study of the semantics and structure of data as an information object used in scholarship and society. This knowledge will be useful when applied to practical activities such as data normalization, cleaning, or packaging for sharing and reuse. We will also pay particular attention to the repository architectures  (technical design) and information infrastructures (technological and social connectivity) that  constrain and afford data access. Throughout the quarter we will draw on research, case studies, and practical working examples in order to examine key challenges in the field. See the videolecture below for an extended introduction to the course, and this book.

## Graduate school during a pandemic       
There is no easy way to put this - its going to be a challenging quarter. I usually put a note in my syllabus that says something along the lines of "...coursework occasionally needs to take a second, third, or fourth priority in your life. All of us have commitments that exceed the expectation of being fully present each week, and I don't expect you to be operating at 100% engagement each day." Even this qualification seems out of touch given the current climate we are operating in for the Spring 2020 quarter. There will be demands on your time, attention, emotions, and cognitive ability to engage with substantive material over the next 10 weeks. There are many unknowns that we are each managing. I have relaxed my own personal expectations for this quarter, and I encourage you all to do the same. This doesn't mean that I will give anything short of 100% effort to delivering a high quality course, but lets operate with a healthy and charitable amount of **good will** towards each other and towards ourselves for the next 10 weeks.

I encourage you all to read my colleague Anna Hoffman's [very personal and incredibly eloquent](https://medium.com/@annaeveryday/altered-is-the-fashion-of-the-earth-teaching-and-learning-during-a-global-pandemic-to-my-e08bd7e473c3) take on the challenges that we face in the quarter that lies ahead.

Here is my adjusted plan to help us navigate the next 10 weeks:

**Accessibility**       

- I have created this book in place of a traditional course site hosted on canvas. I am doing this so I can provide most of the text for what are typically lectures (audio and slides) in a form of written chapters. This makes skimming and digesting the material much easier, and will provide a sustainable resource that you can return to at any time in the future. This book will be downloadable, and all of the course content will remain accessible to you regardless of your being enrolled as a student at UW.

- I will provide a short and hopefully helpful lecture each week, but the majority of the substantive content I am trying to  create for the course will be in the form of written chapters.

- On a week to week basis circumstances may change for how and when you are able to access course materials. I am attempting to provide PDFs or linke to freely available web resources for all readings that are assigned. These will not require you to have any kind of remote VPN or UW affiliated credentials to access. If you cannot, for any reason, access course materials please be in touch and I will attempt to fix the issue as soon as possible.

**Reduced workload and expectations for engagement**    

- I will not use any form of participation in determining your final grade. It is unfortunate, but also unrealistic that we can engage in forum discussions the way that I typically design this course to run. We will still have that opportunity, but keep in mind that I do not expect that your weekly contribution nor will I calculate this into your final mark.

- The Protocol project that makes up a substantive amount of work at the conclusion of this quarter will have some examples from previous courses. I do not expect that you are striving to equal the depth or scope of content that student's in previous courses have had the freedom to execute. See my previous comment about relaxing expectations and demands of ourselves - this doesn't mean that we should give anything less than what we are capable  of- but our capabilities are, collectively, diminished this quarter.

**Maximum flexibility**       

- Everything in this class is negotiable. That applies to grades, assignments, and any course policies. Be in touch when and where you need to negotiate any part of this course, and I can promise you I will be as flexible within the constraints of the University as is possible.

- Assignments have an expected or priority deadline, but these are not hard deadlines. You can turn in assignments at any time throughout the quarter and I will provide feedback as is necessary for you to understand and contextualize the goal of the assignment. I have two requests related to this policy:

1. Please make an earnest effort to keep up with work. I don't know how to design a course (and I'm not sure it is even possible) that doesn't take advantage of progressive knowledge gain. Meaning - practice or exercise in one week can be the baseline for starting an assignment the next week. There will undeniably be moments where this isn't possible - but give it your best effort.

2. Please try to communicate when a priority deadline is not realistic for you to meet (My email is `nmweber@uw.edu`). This can be in advance or after a deadline has passed. You do not need to explain why. If you are falling behind and I havent't had have any communication from you I may reach out with an email. Please don't interpret this as any form of pressure other than my expressing a concern.    

## How this class is organized
There are two aspect of this class that will require your time and attention.

1. Class sessions (Weeks 1-10) follow the typical structure of an iSchool online course.
2. Your `Protocol` assignment has a weekly activity or assignment that you will complete (either as a group or individually). The assignments vary in terms of the effort that will be required - some are involved and will take hours to complete, others are simple readings that will help you think about your protocol.  

**Weekly content**: each week of the course will consist of four components: 1. Readings (required and optional); 2. Written chapters; 3. Recorded lectures; 4. Exercises.  

- Readings are meant to reinforce concepts and offer practical applications or extensions of the concept / topic we are discussing each week.
- Written explanations act like an informal textbook chapter. They are an extended narrative where I attempt to explain, define, and introduce concepts related to data curation. You should read these thoroughly - but also feel free to return to these as a reference resource in the future.
- Short lectures reinforce important points from the chapter and provide an opportunity to present more dynamic content. Where possible I will provide links to slides that are used, and all lectures will be accessible as an MP4 that you can view on any device or with any program of your choosing.
- Excesises: Most weeks I will post an exercise that asks you to engage with open data in some practical way. This might include restructuring a dataset, using a tool, or practicing some skill that is applicable to our weekly topic. A list of exercises are found below. Note that in some weeks there will simply be a demonstration that does not require you to do anything other than watch and engage with the demo. For exercises there is an open discussion forum on Canvas. I encourage you to (following the directions of each excerise) post your response there. Disucssing and debating these exercises is not required but makes for a more enjoyable and interactive course. 

**Protocol Assignments**: Most weeks I will post an assignment activity that you or your group are to complete. The requirements and effort for completing these, as I said earlier, will be variable. These assignments are in service of a final project deliverable. By combining these different assignments you can create a rather comprehensive protocol that will be valuable to your professional portfolio (more below). You can share the protocol assignments with me in advance of our weekly meeting for feedback. I will give you explicit directions on how to do this.

## Grades  

Your grade for this course is made up of three different components: Exercises, Protocol Assignments, and your final Protocol.

- Exercises: Many weeks have a practical exercise component that asks you to apply some concept that is covered in the Chapter or Lecture. You need to complete these by following the directions in each exercise. Completing each exercise is a credit / no-credit mark. Give an earnest effort and you will receive credit. (20% of your final grade)

- Protocol Assignments: Most weeks also have a protocol related assignment. If you complete these before our weekly meetings I can give you feedback and help you structure these so that they are useful to your final deliverable. You only need to complete these by including them in your final protocol deliverable. (20% of your final grade)

- Protocol: The final assignment that is due on or before `June 06 2020` - The assignment is described in detail in the [final chapter of this book](https://nniiicc.github.io/LIS-598-DC2-Sp2020/protocol-assignment.html). In short, the assignment asks you to envision curating and archiving a set of open data that is focused on a particular topic of interest to a particular audience. This builds upon your experience in developing a protocol in DC I. The final protocol can be turned in a variety of formats, but must include all of the components (described in the final chapter) to be given full credit. (60% of your final grade)

I will have a very liberal approach to grading this quarter. Give me your best effort, and I guarantee that I will reciprocate.


## What to do if you find a mistake in this text
