policies:
  - All assignments are due at 11:59 PM Pacific Time unless otherwise noted.
  - If you cannot meet a deadline please get in touch with me 24 hours in advance of the due date to request an extension.
    - I have a "no questions asked" policy on extensions.  I will not ask you to share the personal reasons why you need an extension, but if you would like to share with me for any reason please feel free. I am available listen.
  - If you have not made arrangments with me, all late work will be automatically penalized 10% of the final grade of the assignment (e.g.  If you would have received a 100% you will receive a 90%.)  and will incur a 10% penalty for each additional day that the assignment is not complete.
  - For those of you working in groups, please remember that your group members will be negatively impacted by any unexcused lateness on your part.
