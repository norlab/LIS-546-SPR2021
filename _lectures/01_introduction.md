**Course Overview**
Data Curation II examines a broad range of practical and conceptual issues in the field of data curation. As the second in a sequence of courses offered at the UW iSchool, Data Curation II offers an in-depth study of the semantics and structure of data as an information object used in scholarship and society. This knowledge will be useful when applied to practical activities such as data normalization, cleaning, or packaging for sharing and reuse. We will also pay particular attention to the repository architectures (technical design) and information infrastructures (technological and social connectivity) that constrain and afford data access. Throughout the quarter we will draw on research, case studies, and practical working examples in order to examine key challenges in the field. See the videolecture below for an extended introduction to the course, and this book.
