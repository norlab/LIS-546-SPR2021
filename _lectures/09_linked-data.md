**Required Readings:**
- [Course Content]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/linked-data.html)
- [Allemang, D., & Hendler, J. (2011). Semantic web for the working ontologist: effective modeling in RDFS and OWL. Second Edition](https://canvas.uw.edu/files/65174738/download?download_frd=1)
    - Read Chapter 1 for an introduction to SWâ€™s concepts. If you are interested Chapter 2 gives a bit more detail on how the SW works, and Chapter 3 introduces RDF and knowledge modeling.
- [Ontology Development 101 (Noy and McGuiness)](https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101-noy-mcguinness.html)
    - Read Section 1 and 2; (3 and 4 are optional)
    - Note - this is a classic formulation of what an ontology is and how to create one. The software they reference in building out the example is called Protege (free [https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/)). If you are really keen you can follow along. (For reference - this short list from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)#Components) is quite helpful.)
- [Ontology for Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/ontology-and-data-science-45e916288cc5)
- [Semantic Web for the Legal Domain](https://content.iospress.com/articles/semantic-web/sw224)
