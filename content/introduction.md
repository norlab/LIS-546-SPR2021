# Data Curation II - Introduction
This introductory chapter provides an overview of the conceptual content that we will engage in for DC II. The goal is to refresh our memory about concepts that were covered in DC I and how we will use these ideas throughout DC II.  

## Types of Knowledge
This class builds upon some foundational concepts and ideas that were introduced in Data Curation I. The emphasis of DC I was establishing some best (or good enough) practices for managing and preparing data for meaningful reuse. In introducing conceptual foundations in DC I, I also argued that practicing data curators need to acquire two types of knowledge: Declarative and Procedural. If you've taken a class with me before you know that I think about this type of framework as being broadly useful for all types of learning. But, this framework is especially relevant for data curation.

To review: Procedural knowledge is *how* to do something, and declarative knowledge is knowing that something is the case. In other words, understanding something *about* the factual underpinnings of a concept. Less abstractly - lets use an example from our (now) everyday lives:  

**Declaratively** we know that a virus outbreak has certain distributions that are the direct result of collective action. If we take no action then there will be an increase in the rate of viral infections. But, if we collectively employ techniques like 'social distancing' then the infection rate will remain lower, essential services provided by public health workers will experience less of an impact, and society in general can effectively respond to incidents of viral infection. Over time we've started to refer to this as "flattening the curve" - that is taking collective action to decrease the height of a plotted distribution of infections over time.

**Procedurally** - How do we flatten a curve? Well, we employ techniques like social distancing, we wash our hands, we shut down broad sectors of the economy, we adhere to recommendations from the CDC, etc. It is only through knowing how to effectively combat a viral outbreak that we can put our declarative knowledge into practice. And, we can use realtime data to see whether or not we are actually achieving a 'flattening of the curve'.

Data curation is not so different from this example. We often need to first obtain some declarative knowledge about data and the ways way that it was collected, organized, and analyzed. Understanding the intricacies of these issues helps us to understand how we can design effective interventions. In other words, only after we obtain some declarative knowledge about data can we start to employ procedural techniques for preparing data to be managed and used effectively over time.

In DC I we focused a good deal of our time and effort on obtaining declarative knowledge. In DC II we start to tilt more strongly towards practicing and learning procedural techniques for putting this knowledge to work. In this course I will attempt to help you do this in two ways:

1. Deepening your declarative knowledge about data, management, organization, and encodings that are specific to the types of open data that we are able to reliably access and use via the web. By focusing in particular on open data we have the ability to practice with and use real world examples.
2. Exposing you to tools and strategies for employing these tools effectively in curating open data. Putting declarative knowledge to work takes practice, and it gets easier when we are able to abstract away from the particulars of any one context or any one tool's affordances (and limitations).


## Working Defintions

Before we begin diving into the content of DC II, it will help to revisit some definitions that were established in DC I:

**Data**: Data are various types of digital objects playing the role of evidence. Type and role distinctions have to do with the relational nature of data. A type is rigid (such as a file format) and a role is fluid (it can change given a context). A simple example will help make this clear: I am a person. This is a type. Regardless of any external circumstances I will remain a person. I am also a professor. This is a role that I play. I might, depending on the success of my tenure case, not be a professor in the future. This is simply a professional title that I have for a small amount of time. Data have similar rigid and fluid properties - A tabular dataset will have a type of structure (rows, columns, and values). Unless we take some purposeful action to transform this data it will remain tabular as a type. But, this tabular data might be evidence of some real world phenmena - it might be set of species occurrence records, the perciptation and temperature of a particular place, etc. This evidential role can shift and change depending on who is using the data, and for what purpose.

**FAIR Data**: An emerging shorthand description for open research data - that is applicable to any sector - is the concept of F.A.I.R. FAIR data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We will discuss this concept in a bit more depth throughout this quarter. But, having this shorthand definition of what we try to achieve in doing data curaiton is a helpful reminder for the steps needed to make data truly accessible over the long term. 

**Data curation**: Data curation is the active and ongoing management of data throughout a lifecycle of use, including its reuse in unanticipated contexts. This definition emphasizes that curation is not one narrow set of activities, but is an ongoing *process* that takes into account both material aspects of data, as well as the surrounding community of users that employ different practices while interacting with data and informaiton infrastructures. In DC II there is a particular emphasis on understanding the minutiae of information infrastructures as they relate to curatorial interventions.  

**Metadata**: Metadata is most simply a set of standardized attribute-value pairs that provide contextual information about an object or artifact. Metadata, at an abstract level, has some features which are helpful for unpacking and making sense of the ways that descriptive, technical, and administrative information become useful for a digital object playing the role of evidence. Metadata can and often does include the following:  

- Classes describe concepts that are related to a domain. A domain here means something like an area of application. For example a class of wines would include (or entail) the properties and instances for any wine. Classes are made up of instances, properties, and values (or attributes of an instance). 
- Sub-classes refine a class. A sub-class can be a more specific example of a class. Returning to our wine example, a sub-class of wines might be red, white, or rosé. Another sub-class could divide wines into sparkling or non-sparkling. The point is that a sub-class provides some way to divide or simplify the domain that a class is describing. 
- Instances are observations or concrete examples of a class or sub-class. For example, in an ontology or metadata scheme describing mammals my dog `Yael` is an instance of the sub-class Saluki. A Saluki is an instance of the sub-class Canine, which is an instance of a class of Mammals. A class or sub-class instance also has attributes or properties that define it is a member of that class or sub-class.
- Attributes are defining features of a class or sub-class, and refer to instances. An instance is a member of a class if it has all of the attributes of that class. For example, a Mammal has certain features (reproductive organs, respiratory system, etc) that define its base or necessary attributes for class membership. Canines as a sub-class have a more specific set of attributes that define membership in that sub-class. 
- Relations are the ways that we relate different instances and classes to one another. An instance or a class can be related in one or many ways. 

In DC I we also differentiated data and metadata based on its structure.

**Structured Metadata** Is quite literally a structure of attribute and value pairs that are defined by a scheme. Most often, structured metadata is encoded in a machine readable format like XML or JSON. Crucially, structured metadata is compliant with and adheres to a standard that has defined attributes - such as Dublin Core, EML, DDI.

**Metadata Schemas** define attributes (e.g. what do you mean by “creator” in ecology?); Suggests controls of values (e.g. dates = MM-DD-YYYY); Defines requirements for being “well-formed” (e.g. what fields are required for an implementation of the standard); and, Provide example use cases that are satisfied by the standard.

Structured metadata is, typically, differentiated by its documentation role.

- Descriptive Metadata: Tells us about objects, their creation, and the context in which they were created (e.g. Title, Author, Date)
- Technical Metadata: Tells us about the context of the data collection (e.g. the Instrument, Computer, Algorithm, or some other tool that was used in the processing or collection of the data)
- Administrative Metadata: Tell us about the management of that data (e.g. Rights statements, Licenses, Copyrights, Institutions charged with preservation, etc.)

**Unstructured Metadata** is meant to provide contextual information that is Human Readable. Unstructured metadata often takes the form of contextual information that records and makes clear how data were generated, how data were coded by creators, and relevant concerns that should be acknowledged in reusing these digital objects. Unstructured metadata includes things like codebooks, readme files, or even an informal data dictionary. 

A further important distinction that we made about metadata is that it can be applied to both individual items, or collections or groups of related items. We referred to this as a distinction between **Item and Collection level metadata**.

**Expressivity Vs Tractability.** One of the key concepts we discussed in DC I is the idea that all knwoledge organization activities are a tradeoff between how expressive we make information, and how tractable it is to manage that information. The more expressive we make our metadata, the less tractable it is in terms of generating, managing, and computing for reuse. Inversely, if we optimize our documentation for tractability we sacifice some of the power in expressing information about attributes that define class membership. The challenge of all knowledge representation and organization activities - including metadata and documentation for data curation - is balancing expressivity and tractability.

**Normalization** literally means making data conform to a normal schema. Practically, normalization includes the activities needed for transforming data structures, organizing variables (columns) and observations (rows), and editing data values so that they are consistent, interpretable, and match best practices in a field.

**Data Quality**: From the ISO 8000 definition we assume data quality are "...the degree to which a set of characteristics of data fulfills stated requirements.” In simpler terms data quality is the degree to which a set of data or metadata are fit for use. Examples of data quality characteristics include completeness, validity, accuracy, consistency, availability and timeliness.

## Summary
These basic concepts give us some of the declarative knowledge we need to begin to do data curation work. Over the next ten weeks I will continue to offer working definitions about basic concepts related to DC II readings and topics. It's important to keep in mind these are "working definitions" - they may have important qualifications or need refinement in any particular context. The point of this long review isn't to ask you to memorize these concepts, but instead provide something like a 'term of reference' or knowledge base that we can continue to refine and improve over the course. 

In DC II we are going to tackle topics that help us significantly expand this declarative knowledge. We will look at how to practically decide which type of encoding or representation of data best match the needs of a given community. We will extend the idea of data normalization to include some best practices in creating 'tidy' or useful data for computation. We will also look at how to integrate or combine different datasets, such that we can balance something like expressivity and tractability in reusing this data for a new purpose. 

I will also introduce some more advanced topics that relate to processes of acquiring, packaging, linking, and representing data such that it can be published to the web.
